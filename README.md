# 🌟 LeetUp365: A 4+ Year Journey to Mastering LeetCode

**Welcome to LeetUp365** – my long-term commitment to solving **at least one LeetCode problem daily** for over **four years!**
This repository documents my growth as a developer and problem solver, starting from beginner-level challenges and scaling up to medium and hard problems.

Each solution is accompanied by explanations, thought processes, and insights into data structures, algorithms, and optimization strategies.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of **LeetUp365** is to:

- ✅ Maintain a daily habit of solving algorithmic challenges.
- 📈 Progress from easy to medium and hard LeetCode problems.
- 🧠 Deepen expertise in data structures (e.g., arrays, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking).
- 💼 Prepare for technical interviews and enhance real-world development skills.
- 🤝 Share solutions to inspire and support the learning community.

- **Day-XXX/**: Folders for each day of the challenge (e.g., `Day-001`, `Day-002`).
- **Easy/**, **Medium/**, **Hard/**: Subfolders categorize problems by difficulty.
- Each problem folder (e.g., `two-sum/`) contains:
  - `solution`: The solution file for the problem.
  - `README.md`: Problem statement, approach, time/space complexity, and key insights.
- Problems are named with their LeetCode ID and title for easy navigation.

## 💬 Motivation

> "Small, consistent steps lead to extraordinary results."

**LeetUp365** is more than a repository – it’s a testament to discipline, growth, and the pursuit of mastery. By solving problems daily, I aim to rank among the top problem solvers globally and inspire others to embrace consistent learning. Join me in this journey to solve, learn, and grow!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The solutions and content in this repository are my personal work, created for educational and self-improvement purposes. They are intended to help learners understand problem-solving approaches and techniques. Please use these resources responsibly and in accordance with LeetCode's guidelines. Do not copy solutions directly for submissions, as this undermines the learning process and violates LeetCode's policies.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
